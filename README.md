## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Animate On Scroll Library](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) - For Animation




### What I learned

- I'm really proud of how my positioning skills has grown in CSS, I will love to play with other layout more until I become comfortable with using CSS grid.

- I learnt how to use the animate on scroll library for animation.




### Continued development

I'd love to explore more animation in the future. I'll like to try out more libraries like GSAP and I'd love to build some from scratch too.
